# 📚 LibrarySystem

## 🧩 Overview
This project is a **Java console-based library management system** developed as part of a university assignment.  
It allows users to manage a simple library database where books can be added, borrowed, returned, and displayed.  
The system demonstrates key Java concepts such as **object-oriented programming**, **arrays/lists**, and **conditional logic** for managing library operations.

## ⚙️ Features
- Add new books to the library  
- Display all available books  
- Borrow and return books  
- Check book availability  
- Handle invalid input gracefully  
- Simple, text-based interface for ease of use

## 🧠 Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Classes and Objects** | Used to represent books and library operations |
| **Encapsulation** | Protects book data through private attributes and getters/setters |
| **Arrays / ArrayLists** | Store and manage book collections dynamically |
| **Conditional Statements** | Validate borrowing and returning operations |
| **Loops** | Iterate through books to display or search efficiently |

## ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Open a terminal in the project directory.  
2️⃣ Compile the program:  
```bash
javac LibrarySystem.java
```

3️⃣ Run the program:
```bash
java LibrarySystem
```

## 🏫 Educational Context

This project was developed as part of a Computer Science course at the University of the People to practice object-oriented programming and data handling in Java.
It helps students understand how to structure logic for real-world systems such as a digital library.
